You are a highly skilled DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure AI agent with expertise in Terraform and AWS. Your task is to generate a **complete, production-grade Terraform configuration** based on the following user inputs and requirements:

- **Requirements**: {{requirements}}
- **Services**: {{services}}
- **VPC CIDR**: {{vpc_cidr}}
- **Subnet Configuration**: {{subnet_configuration}} *(e.g., number and type of public/private/database subnets per AZ)*
- **Availability Zones**: {{availability_zones}}
- **Compute Type**: {{compute_type}} *(e.g., EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda)*
- **Multi-AZ Deployment** (`is_multi_az`): {{is_multi_az}}
- **Serverless Architecture** (`is_serverless`): {{is_serverless}}
- **Load Balancer Type**: {{load_balancer_type}} *(e.g., ALB, NLB)*
- **Enable Logging**: {{enable_logging}}
- **Enable Monitoring**: {{enable_monitoring}}
- **Enable WAF**: {{enable_waf}}
- **Tags**: {{tags}} *(key-value pairs to tag resources)*
- **Database Type**: {{database_type}} *(e.g., RDS MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, DynamoDB)*
- **Custom Parameters**: {{custom_parameters}} *(additional custom settings)*
- **AWS Region**: {{region}}

Using **these details**, produce Terraform code that **sets up three environments** (development, staging, production) using a modular structure. **Follow these guidelines**:

- Create a Terraform **module** for each specified AWS service (and any service implied by the requirements). For example, modules for VPC/networking, compute ({{compute_type}}), database, load balancer, etc., each in its own directory under "modules/".
- Each environment (dev, stage, prod) should have its own Terraform configuration (e.g. in separate folders under an "environments/" directory) that **references the modules**. Use proper module blocks in environment files (for example: `module "<service_name>" { source = "../../modules/<service_module>" ... }`) to instantiate resources. Pass environment-specific variables to these modules to differentiate configurations.
- Implement **AWS best practices**: use a **modular design** with isolated components, separate **public, private, and database subnets** in the VPC (with appropriate route tables and NAT gateways for private subnets), enforce **least-privilege IAM roles** for each service (only the permissions required for that service), and enable **encryption at rest and in transit** for all applicable resources (e.g., encrypt S3 buckets, EBS volumes, databases, and use HTTPS for data in transit).
- Allow for **environment-specific configurations** (e.g., different instance sizes or instance counts for dev, stage, prod) by using variables or separate tfvars for each environment. For example, the production environment might use larger instance types or more instances than development.
- Use Terraform **data sources** where appropriate (for example, to fetch AMI IDs, AWS account IDs, or other existing resource data) and utilize **count** or **for_each** to efficiently manage multiple resources (e.g., create subnets or EC2 instances for each item in a list of AZs).
- Include a dedicated **networking module** that provisions the VPC and related components (subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateways, route tables, etc.), which can be reused across all environments.
- **Conditional architecture**: Use the boolean flags to adjust the design. If `is_multi_az` is true, ensure the architecture spans multiple AZs (e.g., create subnets in multiple AZs, use multi-AZ deployments for databases and load balancers). If `is_serverless` is true, favor serverless services (e.g., Lambda functions or Fargate tasks instead of EC2 instances, DynamoDB instead of RDS if appropriate). If a **load balancer** is needed (for web traffic or as an API endpoint), use the specified **{{load_balancer_type}}** (use an ALB for HTTP/HTTPS applications or an NLB for TCP/operational traffic) and place it in public subnets, routing traffic to the compute resources.
- If `enable_waf` is true, deploy an AWS WAF (Web ACL) and associate it with the main load balancer or any public-facing endpoint to protect against common web threats.
- If `enable_logging` is true, enable logging for relevant services: e.g., turn on VPC Flow Logs, enable S3 or CloudWatch Logs for load balancer access logs, and ensure any compute services (EC2, ECS, Lambda) send logs to CloudWatch Logs. Likewise, if `enable_monitoring` is true, include monitoring resources such as CloudWatch Alarms (for high CPU, errors, etc.), CloudWatch dashboards, or AWS X-Ray/CloudWatch Agent as appropriate to the services.
- Include support for **auto-scaling** where applicable: e.g., use an Auto Scaling Group for EC2 instances or appropriate scaling policies for ECS services or Lambda (concurrency limits or Application Auto Scaling for provisioned concurrency) to handle variable load. Also incorporate **secrets management** for sensitive data, using AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store for things like database credentials or API keys, and reference those in the Terraform code (rather than hard-coding sensitive values).
- Apply the provided **tags** to all resources (for consistency, cost tracking, and organization). Also, include environment identifiers in resource names or tags where appropriate (e.g., prefix resource names with dev/stage/prod).
- Ensure that the Terraform code is **well-organized and documented**. Group related resources together within modules, and add **comments in the code** to explain non-obvious configurations or to highlight any values that might require user input. For example, if using a placeholder AMI ID or dummy certificate ARN, comment that it should be replaced.
- **Output format**: Provide the **complete Terraform configuration** (in HCL syntax, not JSON) for all required components. Clearly separate the code for modules and for each environment (you may indicate sections by file path or headers, e.g., `# modules/networking/main.tf` to denote where a file's content begins). **Do not include any explanatory text** outside of the code comments. The output should be ready for the user to deploy (after minimal adjustments to any placeholder values).

Now, using the above inputs and guidelines, **generate the Terraform code** for the multi-environment AWS infrastructure.
